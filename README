A fork of jfricker's AudioStreamer (which is a fork of the original AudioStreamer by mattgallagher)

Forked and cherry-picked to get a number of community addons and fixes:
- Shoutcast metadata [jfricker]
- MIME type detection [andybee]
- HE-AACv2 [idevsoftware]
- Level Metering [idevsoftware]
- NSThread memory leak [mattgallagher]

Fixes and features I've implemented:
- Fixed interruption crashes
- Background buffering
- Play/pause from iPod controls
- Stop all UI updating and timers while backgrounded
- Retina display example
- Support for Pause button in UI
- Local Notifications (outside app) on error

TODO:
- Fix alert spam / Invisible alerts (only happens in app)?
